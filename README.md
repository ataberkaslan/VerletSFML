# Verlet Simulation

This project is a naive example of a simple physics engine using the Verlet integration.
## Installation
In first build Visual Studio will throw error in runtime. To solve the error:
- Copy SFML debug dll files into the `x64/Debug` and SFML dll files into the `x64/Release` folder.
- You can find files in [SFML download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) page.
- Download the .zip file and you can find dlls in `./bin` folder. Files that ends with `-d.dll` are debug dll files.
- You must also copy `openal.dll` file into the folders.
